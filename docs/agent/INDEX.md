## Tool Entry Files

`AGENTS.md` is the canonical entry. Other tool-specific entry files are thin
pointers that must not duplicate rules:

- Codex / generic AI: `AGENTS.md` (canonical)
- Claude Code: `CLAUDE.md` → `AGENTS.md`
- Cursor: `.cursor/rules/00-entry.mdc` → `AGENTS.md`

Do not assume any of these were auto-loaded by another tool. If you support a
different assistant (Aider, Continue, Windsurf, Zed, Cline, etc.), add a one-line
pointer file in the format that tool expects and keep `AGENTS.md` as the source.
